orderparams

j.mithen@surrey.ac.uk

code for computing order parameters.
see src/main.cpp for the order parameters computed.
see example/ directory for a params file for running the code.

To compile the code, navigate to the main directory and type 'make'.

To run the example, navigate to the examples directory and type
../orderparams/ params.out

TODO
-----------

- improve (simplify) Makefile

- improve reading parameters from params.out (?)
  could possibly read from params.pkl with interface to
  python code.

- in box.h make box lengths private and create method(s) for changing size

- add more order parameters?
